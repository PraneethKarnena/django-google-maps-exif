##  Distance Matrix - Django

This is a simple Django project to calculate shortest distance between any given number of multiple coordinates.

The coordinates are extracted from image EXIF data.

### How this works:

 - Enter a Source image
 - Enter Waypoints or through-route image(s)
 - Enter a Destination image
 - The system will calculate the `shortest` path between the Source and Destination, through the Waypoints.
 - A beautiful Map is generated
